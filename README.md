# Selector_Practice
Use `npx open cypress` to open cypress
If that doesn't work, please make sure you have  `nvm add 18` and `npm use 18` on there. 

The app lives in introdemo. 

General commit process is:
1. clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/alexjoel42/Selector_Practice.git `
2. Use `npm install` to get the packages installed **inside of introdemo**
3. Use `npm run dev` **inside of introdemo**
4. Use `git checkout -b "name of branch"` to branch off of it
5. Edit and `npm run dev` to edit accordingly
6. Use `git status` after you add something to check what you added against the main repo
7. Use `git add .` to add all the things
8. Use `git commit -m "insert message here"` to commit
9. Use `git push` to push to your branch
10. Then I'll merge the PR :) .
